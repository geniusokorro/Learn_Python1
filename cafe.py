Study Notes 
another way to declare a dictionary is from a list but with keys
stock = dict( 1 = 'Beans'...) won't work as int cannot be assigned to string
stock = dict( food1 = 'Beans', food2 = 'Rice', food3 = 'Spaghetti', food4 = 'Sauce-de-gombo')
##to add to dictionary:::
name_of_dict["new_key"] = "new_value"
##pop from a dictionary:::
declare_variable = dict_name.pop('key_to_pop')
##iterate through a dictionary
for i in dict_name.keys():
for i in dict_name.values():
for i,j in dict_name.items()

# num_list = ['1','5','8','14','25','31']
# new_num_list_ints = [int(element)for element in num_list]
# print(new_num_list_ints)
